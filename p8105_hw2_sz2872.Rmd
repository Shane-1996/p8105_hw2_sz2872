This is my solution for hw2.

```{r setup}
library(tidyverse)
library(readxl)
```

## Problem 1

Read the Mr. Trash Wheel sheet `trim_ws = FALSE`
```{r load mr_trash_wheel}
mr_trash_wheel_df = read_excel("./data/Trash-Wheel-Collection-Totals-8-6-19.xlsx", sheet = "Mr. Trash Wheel", range = "A2:N408")
mr_trash_wheel_df
```
